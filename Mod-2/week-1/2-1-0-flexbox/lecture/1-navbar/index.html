        <h2>Gravity</h2>
        <p>
          We account for one-sixth of the forces of gravity we see in the
          universe. There is no known objects accounting for most of the
          effective gravity in the universe. Something is making stuff move that
          is not anything we have ever touched.

        <h2>Revealing The Universe</h2>
        <p>
          People credit me for making the universe interesting when in fact the
          universe is inherently interesting, and I'm merely revealing that
          fact. I don't think I'm anything special for this to happen.

        <h2>Investment</h2>
        <p>
          When you put money directly to a problem, it makes a good headline. It
          makes a good campaign slogan. You get to claim that you've engaged in
          these activities within an election cycle. But certain investments
          take longer than an election cycle.

        <h2>The Truth of Data</h2>
        <p>
          Any time scientists disagree, it's because we have insufficient data.
          Then we can agree on what kind of data to get; we get the data; and
          the data solves the problem. Either I'm right, or you're right, or
          we're both wrong. And we move on. That kind of conflict resolution
          does not exist in politics or religion.

        <h2>Survival of the Stealthiest</h2>
        <p>
          In the animal kingdom, one of the keys to survival is to outwit your
          enemies. And when you're surrounded by carnivores, one of the best
          strategies is to fade into the background and disappear.
